				<summary>summary and details</summary>
				<p>Competing ideas about the relationships of mammal orders do persist and are currently in development.<br>

			<h2>Insects</h2>
			<p>Insects are pancrustacean hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta. They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum.<br>
			Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body, three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>summary and details</summary>
				<p>Nearly all insects hatch from eggs. Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts.<br>
				The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage metamorphosis.</p>

			<h2>Amphibians</h2>
			<p>Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. All living amphibians belong to the group Lissamphibia.<br>
			They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems</p>
			<details>
				<summary>summary and details</summary>
				<p>The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs.<br>
				Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin.</p>
