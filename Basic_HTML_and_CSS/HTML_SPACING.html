			<p>	No one expects you to memorize the complete syntax of every programming language.<br>
				Working developers spend a lot of time online looking up code, finding solutions and debugging.<br>
				For example: after you graduate, it’s completely normal to Google questions like,<br> 
				<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“How to insert an image in HTML?” or “How to add a CSS border to a webpage?”</span><br>
				– even senior-level developers with decades of experience operate this way.</p>
